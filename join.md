title: Join The Club
---

In order to join, you need to be a WVU student, and you'll need to pay the $30 membership fee per year, which we use to maintain gear and obtain housing for our big fall and spring trips. 

Fill out our [member form](https://forms.gle/tdZdxEPATzYhAq3BA) to get on our mailing list, apply on [WVUENGAGE](https://wvuengage.wvu.edu/organization/wvuclimbingclub), and pay the member dues, and you'll be set for the whole year! Club gear can be borrowed for personal trips, and you'll get invited to our GroupMe group chat, where you can find tons of other climbers at WVU!
