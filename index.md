subtitle: For the pursuit of greatness

For those who came to West Virginia University to get closer to the state's natural scenery and outdoor recreation, the WVU Climbing Club is the ultimate group to adventure, explore, and make new friends in the mountains of WV. The club is open to first-time climbers and hardcore crushers alike, taking as many weekend trips to camp and climb as we can afford. The club also hosts socials, gym days, and climbing workshops throughout the year to help teach newcomers the basics of the sport.

We do several events throughout the year, we teach instructional workshops to learn practical outdoor climbing skills, go on single-day and multi-day trips, and we have big trips during fall break and spring break to areas like the New and the Red!

Our typical schedule looks like this: Tuesday nights we hold workshop days or open climb days, and most weekends we'll host a day trip or overnight camping trip to a local crag! Check out our schedule below for up-to-date plans, and our [FAQ]({{ '/faq' | relative_url }}) for any questions!
